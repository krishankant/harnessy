# Week 3: Tools

**Time:** about 5 hours (1.5 reading, 3 building, 30 minutes on notes).

**Before you start:** the week 3 tests run through your `Agent`, so your week 2 loop must pass `uv run pytest tests/week2`.

**You're done when:**

1. `uv run pytest tests/week3` passes (50 tests), and `tests/week2` still passes after you wire the registry in (section 9), and
2. `uv run python -m scripts.week3_demo` writes and reads back a haiku on both providers.

## 1. Read first

## 2. Tools are prompts

The model never sees your Python function. It sees three things: a **name**, a **description** and a **JSON Schema** for the parameters. Then, after the call, it sees whatever text you send back. All four are prompts.

This week you stop writing schemas by hand. You write a normal function:

```python
@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers.

    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.
    """
    return a + b
```

and `@tool` produces what the model sees:

```json
{"name": "add", "description": "Add two integers.",
 "parameters": {"type": "object",
   "properties": {"a": {"type": "integer", "description": "The first number."},
                  "b": {"type": "integer", "description": "The second number."}},
   "required": ["a", "b"], "additionalProperties": false}}
```

The type hints, the default values and the docstring become the schema. There's one source of truth, and it can't drift from the function.

## 3. Tour of the given code

- **`harnessy/types.py`: `Tool` moved here** from `loop.py`, and gained two optional fields, `timeout_s` and `max_chars`, for per-tool limits. `from harnessy.loop import Tool` still works. (It moved because the registry needs `Tool` and the loop needs the registry. Leaving it in `loop.py` would be a circular import.)
- **`harnessy/tools/schema.py`**: `parse_docstring` splits a Google-style docstring into the description and per-parameter text. `tool` is the decorator. It works bare (`@tool`) or with options (`@tool(timeout_s=5, max_chars=2000)`), and returns a `Tool` whose `fn` is your original function.
- **`harnessy/tools/registry.py`**: `ToolRegistry.specs()` lists the specs in order. `ToolRegistry.expected(tool)` turns a tool's parameters into `"a: integer, b: integer"` for error messages.
- **`harnessy/tools/files.py`**: `file_tools(root)` returns `read_file` (line-numbered, with `offset` and `limit`) and `write_file`, both limited to one folder.
- **`harnessy/tools/web.py`**: `http_get`, built with `@tool` at import time.
- **`harnessy/tools/__init__.py` imports nothing, on purpose.** `web.py` runs `@tool` when it's imported, and `@tool` needs your exercises. If `__init__.py` imported it, every `harnessy.tools` import would fail until you'd finished the week. Import from the submodules instead: `from harnessy.tools.registry import ToolRegistry`.

## 4. The rules your validator follows

The model will send wrong arguments: a string where you wanted a number, a missing field, a field you never defined. Your registry checks the call against the schema **before** running the function, so the error names the exact problem.

It checks only what the schema says, using JSON Schema's own rules:

| Rule | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Every name in `required` must be there | The most common mistake after a long conversation. |
| An unknown name is an error **only if `additionalProperties` is `false`** | JSON Schema allows extra names by default. `@tool` sets it to `false`. Your week 2 tests use hand-written specs that don't, so extra names still pass there, and a missing Python argument still ends up as a `TypeError`. That's why week 2 keeps passing. |
| Each value matches its `type` | `"17"` is not an `integer`. |
| **`True` is not an integer** | In Python, `isinstance(True, int)` is `True`. In JSON, a boolean is not a number. Check `bool` first. |
| An `int` *is* a valid `number` | `3` is fine where `3.0` is expected. |
| `enum` | For `Literal["asc", "desc"]` parameters. |
| Items of an `array` | One level deep is enough. |
| `{"_raw": ...}` | Week 1's marker for arguments that weren't valid JSON. Say that, rather than "unknown parameter `_raw`". |

## 5. Errors are instructions

Every error your registry returns ends with what to do next:

```
Invalid arguments for 'add': 'a' must be integer, got str 'seventeen'. Expected parameters: a: integer, b: integer.
Unknown tool 'sub'. Available tools: add, read_file.
Tool 'http_get' timed out after 15s. Try a smaller request.
```

The model reads these on the next step. A good error message is the cheapest way to get a model to fix its own call. The `test_wiring.py` "done when" test checks exactly this: a bad call, a readable error, then a fixed call.

**Timeouts, with one caveat.** The registry runs each tool in a worker thread and waits at most `timeout_s`. When the wait runs out, the loop moves on, but Python can't kill a thread, so a hung tool keeps running in the background. Make it a **daemon** thread (`threading.Thread(..., daemon=True)`): a `ThreadPoolExecutor` worker would keep your whole program from exiting until the hung tool finished, possibly forever. `test_a_hung_tool_does_not_keep_the_process_alive` checks this. A thread that keeps running is fine for reads. It's not fine for a tool that changes things. Week 7 moves risky tools into a subprocess that can be killed.

## 6. Truncation

One `read_file` on a log file can be 50,000 characters, and all of it would go into the context. So the registry cuts every result to `max_chars` (4,000 by default) and **says it did**:

```
[truncated: showing the first 4,000 of 51,200 characters]
```

If you cut silently, the model thinks it saw everything. With the note, it can ask for the next part. `read_file` goes one step further and tells the model exactly how: `call again with offset=201 for more`.

## 7. Safety lives in code

`file_tools(root)` can only touch files inside `root`. That's enforced by `resolve_inside`, not by a line in the system prompt. It has to reject three kinds of path:

- `../secret`: the `..` climbs out.
- `/etc/passwd`: in Python, `root / "/etc/passwd"` *is* `/etc/passwd`.
- `link/secret`, where `link` is a symlink pointing outside. `Path.resolve()` follows it, so check *after* resolving.

A rejected path raises `ValueError`, and the registry turns that into an error result like any other tool failure.

## 8. Exercises

Do them in this order. `@tool` needs 3a and 3b, and most other tests use `@tool`.

Until 3a and 3b pass, four test files (`test_registry.py`, `test_web.py`, both `test_wiring.py`) show up as **collection errors**: they use `@tool` at import time, and the error names the exercise to finish. Every other test still runs.

| # | Function | File | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3a | `json_type` | `tools/schema.py` | `uv run pytest tests/week3/test_schema.py -k "types or literal or optional or unsupported"` |
| 3b | `schema_from_function` | `tools/schema.py` | `uv run pytest tests/week3/test_schema.py` |
| 3c | `validate_args` | `tools/registry.py` | `uv run pytest tests/week3/test_registry.py -k "no_problems or missing_required or unknown_param or wrong_type or bool or valid_number or enum or array_items or json_marker"` |
| 3d | `truncate` | `tools/registry.py` | `uv run pytest tests/week3/test_registry.py -k test_truncate` |
| 3e | `ToolRegistry.call` | `tools/registry.py` | `uv run pytest tests/week3/test_registry.py` |
| 3f | `resolve_inside` | `tools/files.py` | `uv run pytest tests/week3/test_files.py tests/week3/test_web.py` |

Hints:

- **3a:** `typing.get_origin(list[int])` is `list` and `get_args` gives `(int,)`. `str | None` has origin `types.UnionType`, while `Optional[str]` has origin `typing.Union`. Handle both.
- **3b:** use `typing.get_type_hints(fn)`, not `param.annotation`, because it resolves string annotations like `"int"` from `from __future__ import annotations`.
- **3c:** write a small `_type_ok(value, schema)` helper, and check `bool` before the `isinstance` test.

## 9. Wire it into your loop

Your `Agent` still runs tools its own way, with the `_by_name` dict from week 2. Hand that job to the registry. In **your** `harnessy/loop.py`:

1. Add the import:

   ```python
   from harnessy.tools.registry import ToolRegistry
   ```

2. Replace the `_by_name` field and `__post_init__` with:

   ```python
       _registry: ToolRegistry = field(init=False, repr=False)

       def __post_init__(self) -> None:
           self._registry = ToolRegistry(self.tools)
   ```

3. In `run`, get the specs from the registry: `specs = self._registry.specs()`.
4. Replace the whole body of `_run_tool` with:

   ```python
           return self._registry.call(call)
   ```

Then run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/week2 tests/week3
```

Week 2 must still pass. Its error-handling tests now go through the registry.

## 10. Try it live

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.week3_demo                     # both providers
uv run python -m scripts.week3_demo --provider openai
```

Each run gets a fresh temporary folder. You should see `write_file`, then `read_file` with line numbers, then an answer of 3 lines, and the script prints the file it found on disk.

**Stretch.** Give `write_file` two descriptions, a one-liner and a detailed one, and run the demo 5 times with each. Write down how often the model called it correctly the first time. In week 5 you'll turn this into a real eval.

## 11. Check yourself

- `HARNESSY_IMPL=solutions uv run pytest tests/week3` runs the tests against the reference solutions.
- `diff harnessy/tools/registry.py solutions/harnessy/tools/registry.py` once yours passes.
- `diff harnessy/loop.py solutions/harnessy/loop.py` shows your loop next to the reference, with the wiring in both.

## 12. Notes for `NOTES.md`

1. In the demo, did either model ever get a validation error? If you force one (rename a parameter in the prompt), what does the model do with the message on the next step?
2. Name one tool you'd want in a real agent that should be confined the way `file_tools` is. What is its "root"?
3. Longer descriptions cost tokens on every single call. When is that worth it?
